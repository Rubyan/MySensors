# MySensors
Collection of arduino sketches for mysensors 2.0

These sketches are used in my home automation project with domoticz. There is a lot of temperature measurement going on, and there is one relay switch. 
I'm using arduino pro mini's 5V 16MHz, and arduino nano's. All parts are bought on aliexpress.
